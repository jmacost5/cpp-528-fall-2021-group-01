# Trash - Storing Unnecessary and Old Files

## Directory Purpose

This directory stores extra files that are outdated, incorrect, or unnecessary for the project. 

## Directory Organization

**2021-03-14-ch01-example_page.md** and **2021-12-12-ch10-s_type_test.md**: these files were removed from the posts directory as they do not contribute to the Table of Contents.

**2021-11-01-DataManagement.md**, **2021-11-13-ch03-predicting_change.md**, **data_manifest.md**, **part_1.md**, **part_2.md**, and **part_3.md**:
these files were attempts at creating .md files and chapters without using 01_create_md_files.R. This idea was scrapped and the files were removed from the main 
directory.

We have worked through and shown the steps taken to analyze the impact for two tax incentive programs: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the New Market Tax Credit (NMTC). Both programs are federally funded programs intended to help low income communities. But do the programs realize an impact on the communities it is intended to help? As seen in Chapter 5, the results vary.
Between 2000 and 2010, houses rose an average of 51% in value. The NMTC program shows no difference in the treatment and control groups as evidenced by the non-statistically-significant coefficient. The LIHTC program does have a statistically significant coefficient which indicates that houses participating in the program rose an average of .03% *more* than non-participating homes for a total of 51.03%. Neither program is having a strong impact, but the LIHTC impact is greater than than the NMTC program.

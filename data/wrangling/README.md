#### Data wrangling

Data wrangling includes all of the steps in building, restructuring, and fixing the data through cleaning or reformatting. These processes should all occur during the data engineering steps

- It include mostly scripts and intermediary steps you use to clean and transform your data. 

- Any intermediary datasets you produce as part of the process that are not used in the final analysis can also live here. 

- we will also include descriptive reports or tables that I create to check for errors in the datasets or to describe the data if any .

Feature engineering, the process of creating new measures by applying algorithms or mathematical models to existing data, often using advanced tools like geo-spatial algorithms or machine-learning models,is another kind of data engineering step.

Variable transformations, however, are an important component of the modeling process that often require interative processes of testing multiple specifications for model fit and to identify issues related to outliers, etc. As such, variable transformations are typically a part of the analysis dataset. So there is not a pure distinction between the two.
Use your judgement about where to draw the line to keep the process well-organized and file delineation clear.

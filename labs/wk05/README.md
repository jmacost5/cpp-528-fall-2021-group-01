
# Overview
In this lab, we added data from two tax incentive programs - the New Market Tax Credit and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit - to see whether the federal programs are having an impact on housing markets. The lab uses the city of San Francisco, CA as a reference point, utilizing the difference-in-difference model to analyze the impact (or lack thereof) of each program within the city of San Francisco.

This last step in your project will walk you through adding data from two federal programs designed to help low-income communities.

## Evaluating Program Impact
The treatment in our evaluation is whether a tract received one of the large federal tax credit programs that are designed to crowd private capital into poor neighborhoods.

We can think about the treatment in two ways: binary (were programs awarded to or located in a tract, or now?), or levels (was impact related to the amount of treatment they received?

# Lab 04 - Predicting MHV Change

## File Purpose

This lab was performed to create a baseline model of neighborhood change in median home value (MHV) growth. After some data cleaning, three census variables were chosen as controls to predict change in MHV between 2000 and 2010.

## File Organization

**Lab-04-McIntyre.Rmd**: an R Markdown file containing code to accomplish the File Purpose. Functions and datasets used in the code are located in an R file ("analysis/utilities_master.R") which is loaded using the import::here() function.

**Lab-04-McIntyre.html**: a knitted html file of the Rmd file.
